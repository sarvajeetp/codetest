In a solution, Animal & Bird are general category classes.
which can have specialized category classes like cat & duck respectively.

In order to avoid redundant code and to make code more maintanable, 
default implementation of each beahviour (singing, walking, flying) has been provided.

Also, Not all bird sings so, only Parrot in an example implements singing behaviour.
